Participating in #MakeoverMonday for the first time. This week the palmer penguins dataset is featured.

I was interested in looking at whether the three different species of penguins have different timing for laying their eggs. Adelie penguins lay their eggs around mid-November, Chinstraps lay them in the latter-half of November, and Gentoos lay eggs throughout Nov but they're somewhat bimodal at the beginning and end of the month.
